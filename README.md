# Shaker
Shaker is Android app that allows users to see recent earthquakes from around the world and a visually stimulating way.Shaker wa spawned from my interest in geology and the discovery of the USGS( United States Geological Survey) API that provides the data to Shaker. The app is useful in that its quick and mobile and provides users with detailed information about events as well as links to that event  on the USGS site.

Currently Shaker functions properly. However there are features that would greatly improve the functionality of the app. Future versions of the app would ideally implement the following; 

-The ability for users to specify a date or dates to filter events.
-The ability for users to view the event information card by clicking on that event on the map.
-The ability for users to create pins and get notifications when events occur near the created pins.

Shaker is restricted to portrait orientation, and may or may not benefit from the ability to change orientation. Shakers appearance is satisfactory on standard screen sizes but is less appealing on larger screens such as tablets. 

Shaker was created with a target API level of 28 and has a minimum level of 21. Shaker was tested in the following environments;

- Nexus 5X API 27 (emulated)
- Nexus 10 API 27 (emulated)
- Pixel API 24 (emulated)
- OnePlus 6t API 28
